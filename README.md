Practice the Julialang ML workflow using data from [Acea Smart Water Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/c/acea-water-prediction/overview) competition.


# How to Use
This instruction is for **Ubuntu** and **Windows 10/11** user.

Please note that we use docker to run containers, and **containers running on Windows 10 cannot access native GPU resources (more specifically NVIDIA CUDA)** under normal circumstances.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is an instruction to establish a development environment, not a deployment environment.

## Prerequisite
1. Git
1. Docker and Docker Compose
1. VS Code

If you are a **Windows** user, please install the additional tools.
1. Windows Terminal
1. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Please refer to each section to install the necessary tools.

### Windows Terminal (Windows User)
You can download Windows Terminal from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-tw/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) to get a better terminal experience.

### WSL (Windows User)
> You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11.
> If you're running an older build, or just prefer not to use the install command and would like step-by-step directions, see [WSL manual installation steps for older versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).

1. Open the terminal. Then, install **WSL2** and the Ubuntu-20.04 distribution as default with the following command.
    ```powershell
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
    wsl --set-default Ubuntu-20.04
    ```
1. Check if your Ubuntu-20.04 distribution uses **WSL 2**.
    ```powershell
    wsl -l -v
    ```
    If your Ubuntu-20.04 distribution uses WSL 1, please use the following command to set your Ubuntu-20.04 distribution to use WSL 2.
    ```powershell
    wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
    ```

### Git
We will use Git installed in the container for version control. VS Code will detect the git configuration file in the host and bring the basic configuration to the container (thanks to VS Code üôå), so please follow the instructions below to set it up
#### Windows
1. Open the terminal and start the Ubuntu-20.04 shell.
    ```powershell
    wsl
    ```
1. Set global configuration file (~/.gitconfig).
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è You should change the YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_EMAIL to your own.
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
    git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
    ```

#### Ubuntu
I think you can set up basic ~/.gitconfig file smoothly. üòÉ

### Docker and Docker Compose
#### Windows
1. Download **Docker desktop for Windows** from [official website](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) and install it.
1. Start Docker Desktop, and select **Settings (gear icon in the upper right corner) > General** to check whether the **Use WSL 2 based engine** check box is selected. If it is not checked, please select it.

#### Ubuntu
I think you can install docker and docker compose smoothly by yourself. üòÉ

### VS Code
1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.
1. Install **Remote Development** from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).


## Setup Development Environment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure docker is running in the background.

### Windows
1. Start **VS Code**.
1. Click **Remote Explorer** tab in the left side bar.
1. Select **WSL Targets** in the drop-down menu to display the available WSL targets.
1. Click the **Connect to WSL icon** on the right side of the Ubuntu-20.04 label.
1. Switch to the new window connected to WSL (check if there is a prompt for **WSL: Ubuntu-20.04** in the lower left corner of the window)
1. Click **Source Control** tab in the left side bar.
1. Click the **Clone Repository** to clone this repo.
1. Paste the **repository URL** into the interactive prompt at the top center of the window and press "Enter".
1. In the interactive prompt at the top center of the window, select the **preferred path to store the cloned repository** and press "Enter"
1. After the clone is successful, a notification will appear in the lower right corner to remind you to open the cloned repository. Please click **"Open"**.
1. After successfully opening the project in WSL, a notification will be displayed in the lower right corner to remind you that you can use the container. Click **"Reopen in Container"** to building the image and run the container.
1. When image and container are successfully built, press **``ctrl+shift+` ``** in VS Code to open integrated terminal . Download all the dependencies of the current julia project and precompile them with the following command.
    ```bash
    inv env.init-dev
    ```
1. Your development environment has been well established. You can leave VS Code or jump to [Usage](#usage) section to learn about development steps and details.


### Ubuntu

## Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è
> - Make sure docker is running in the background.
> - Ensure that the development environment is set up correctly.
> - If your container is gone, please following the [Setup Development Environment](#setup-development-environment) section to generate a new container.

Follow the instruction below to run container.
1. Start **VS Code**.
1. Click **Remote Explorer** tab in the left side bar.
1. Select **Containers** in the drop-down menu to display the available Dev Containers.
1. Click the **Open Folder in Container icon** on the right side of the acea-smart-water-analytics label.
1. The VS Code will reopen the window that connect the container (check if there is a prompt for **Dev Container: acea-smart-water-analytics** in the lower left corner of the window).


### Predefined Tasks
> ‚ö†Ô∏è The predefined tasks defined in the `tasks` directory use relative paths, so make sure that the current working directory is **acea-smart-water-analytics**

When VS Code is connected to the container, you can use the integrated terminal (press **``ctrl+shift+` ``** to open terminal) to run following tasks.

- Install development dependencies and setup pre-commit hooks.
    ```bash
    inv env.init-dev
    ```
- Download all dependencies of the current julia project and precompile all dependencies.
    ```bash
    inv env.julia-instantiate
    ```
- Run `jupyter lab` at notebooks directory.
    ```bash
    inv nb.lab
    ```
- Run `Pluto.jl` at notebooks directory.
    ```bash
    inv nb.pluto
    ```
- Format your code through `JuliaFormatter.jl`.
    ```bash
    inv style.reformat
    ```
- Run test cases.
    ```bash
    inv test
    ```
